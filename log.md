## DAY-01 26th JULY 2018 <h3>
### Today's Progress :
Today I learned math basics, which are prerequisites of learning ML  
Linear algebra functions and basic algebra variables, co efficient etc
### Thoughts :
As i skipped this lesson in my past days feeling guilty for that   
and being happy about that I'm learning this thing again and improving myself  
I was before, and seeing better version of myself.

## DAY-02 27th JULY 2018

### Today's Progress :
Started with a course on [edX](www.edx.org) for Essential Mathematics for  ML will take some time to complete the  
course currently learning Algebra and Basic with Python 3
### Thoughts :
Learning is a good habit as i learned, and i never studied this way before i want myself to fall in love
with learning. I love reading articles i always do. But i never studied before like now I'm doing. Thanks to [Siraj Raval](http://www.youtube.com/c/sirajraval) to lead us to the path.
